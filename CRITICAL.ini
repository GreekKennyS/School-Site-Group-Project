CRITICAL: Open virtual_tour.js. Look for the locations array. For each location,
you MUST adjust the x and y percentage values for each hotspot.

How to get x and y?
Open your image in an image editor (like GIMP, Photoshop, or even Paint).
Hover your mouse over the desired hotspot location. Note its pixel coordinates (X, Y).
Note the total width and height of the image in pixels.
Calculate:

x_percentage = (X_hotspot_pixel / Image_Width_pixel) * 100
y_percentage = (Y_hotspot_pixel / Image_Height_pixel) * 100
